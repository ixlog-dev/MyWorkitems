Scriptable Widget for Workitems

In SAP Systems business processes in applications are executed by workflows. Workflows are a tool for the automation of the business process and a crucial component of SAP Systems. Each workflow goes through several single-steps called workitems. The workitems can be shown in the Business Workplace (Transaction SBWP) at the “My Inbox” App. A much easier access is provided by our recently developed widget based on the new Scriptable-App which is freely available for iPhones since iOS 14. This App became very popular by widgets like Covid-19-incidence-widget, which shows the number of infections in a determinate city, and the much more important toilet-paper-widget, which shows the amount of toilet paper available in the next drugstore.
